    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "In the not-so-distant future, Earth's astronomers have developed advanced instruments that can detect **3 different signals** from deep space. These signals are captured from distant **solar systems**, **stars**, and **galaxies**, but their true nature remains unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decode this cosmic mystery, astronomers need your data science expertise to **analyze the signals** and **identify meaningful clusters** that may represent different celestial phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each signal spectrum contains values simulated from a multimodal distribution representing natural astrophysical variations in emission levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to apply **unsupervised learning techniques** to uncover the hidden structure in the universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset should be available to you as part of the zip file you downloaded from the coding task assessment. It should contain 3 signal columns `signal_1`, `signal_2`, `signal_3` (all real and continuous) and `10000` datapoints. Use the same random `seed` setting provided on your the first task. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to complete the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load, inspect and analyze** the provided signal data.\n",
    "2. **Standardize** the features appropriately.\n",
    "3. Use the any suitable technique) to determine the optimal number of clusters.\n",
    "4. Apply a clustering algorithm to group the data.\n",
    "5. **Evaluate** your clustering using relevant metrics.\n",
    "6. **Visualize** the results.\n",
    "7. Provide a brief **explanation** of your choices.\n",
    "8. Upload the clustering output csv on the portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSV output format:\n",
    "| output    | \n",
    "| -------- |\n",
    "| 1  |\n",
    "| 4 |\n",
    "| 5    |\n",
    "| 3    |\n",
    "| 2    |\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on for all data points given in the input. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are example cluster labels. Note that the problem may or may not have 5 clusters and the labels given here are indicative of how the output is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Can Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python (NumPy, Pandas etc.)\n",
    "- Standard data science libraries for preprocessing, clustering, evaluation, and plotting (scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Do not use AutoML tools for this task.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code is well-structured, readable, and logically organized\n",
    "- Appropriate preprocessing, cluster selection, and algorithm choice\n",
    "- Proper use of releavant metrics\n",
    "- Effective use of cluster plots; clear labeling and legends\n",
    "- Clarity of explanantion\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "- An implementation of a clustering algorithm from scratch. *WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS AND THIS IS A BIG BONUS!*\n",
    "- Try multiple clustering algorithms and compare their performance.\n",
    "- An attempt to interpret the results.\n",
    "  - Should there have been more clusters on your output based on your analysis?\n",
    "  - If so, what casued your current implementation to not extract these insights?\n",
    "  - Was it a gap with the data or the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"

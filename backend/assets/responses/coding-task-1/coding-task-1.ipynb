    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Earthâ€™s leading astrophysics research agency is investigating distant stars and galaxies through a mysterious form of **luminescent signal** emitted across the **visible spectrum**. These signals, measured in the classic **VIBGYOR** bands (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red), show unusual patterns suggesting the presence of **multiple astrophysical sources**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to **simulate such signals** using a **multi-modal normal distribution**, where each mode represents a distinct celestial emission source, and to **visualize & analyze the resulting distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to **implement** the following simulation pipeline from scratch using the *random seed* configuration given to you in the portal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`sample_means_and_stds`**  \n",
    "   A function to sample `7` means and standard deviations (s.t.d. to not be more than `0.6` of mean) within a given value range `(-1000, 1000)`, ensuring the means are well-separated (by `3 s.t.d`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`generate_multi_modal_normal`**  \n",
    "   A function that generates a combined dataset from multiple normal distributions using the sampled means and standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`simulate_luminescence_vibgyor`**  \n",
    "   A function that:\n",
    "   - Defines the visible light spectrum as 7 channels: `Violet`, `Indigo`, `Blue`, `Green`, `Yellow`, `Orange`, `Red`.\n",
    "   - Samples means and standard deviations.\n",
    "   - Generates data for each color band using your multi-modal distribution function.\n",
    "   - Returns a dictionary of generated data, and the sampled parameters.\n",
    "4. Generate 10000 datapoitns and upload the generated signal values to the portal.\n",

    "and so on for 10000 datapoints.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Analysis Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your simulation functions are implemented, perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visualize the distributions** for each color band using histograms or density plots.\n",
    "2. Compute basic **summary statistics**. i.e. the diffent moments of a normal disctibution. What are your insights on the `4` moments of the distribution?\n",
    "3. Comment on the **multi-modal structure**: Are all bands equally separated? Do some show overlap?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Can Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may use libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementation of required functions and statistical logic\n",
    "- Code readability, modular design, and use of comments  \n",
    "- Correct interpretation of summary statistics and multi-modal distributions\n",
    "- Clarity and effectiveness of visual outputs\n",
    "- Overall clarity, structure, and readability of the notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, teleportation technology has become viable for interstellar travel. A **teleportation machine** can transport a traveler between any two planets as long as the distance between them is within a fixed threshold. This is beacuse the teleporation machine works on the principle of disintegration and reintegration of molecules between the target and destination. The threshold is the teleportation device's limitation and any path taken beyond that will lead to fatal disintegration of the traveller. Each planet is assigned a position in 3D space, and travel is only allowed between **direct neighbors** â€” planets within a maximum teleportation distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission: help scientists **determine the shortest path from Earth to a specific planet** using the newly available planetary coordinates and teleportation constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth is located at coordinate `(0, 0, 0)`. You are provided with a dataset of **planet names** and their **3D coordinates** (`x`, `y`, `z`). You are also provided with the name of the **target planet**, and the teleportation machine's **maximum range** (distance constraint).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Available Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset should be available to you as part of the zip file you downloaded from the coding task assessment. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Planet`: Name of the planet\n",
    "- `x`, `y`, `z`: Spatial coordinates of the planet\n",
    "- `Rock`, `Water`, `Air`, `Fire`: Elemental composition proportions of the planet (each between 0 and 1)\n",
    "- `Liveable`: Binary label (`Yes`/`No`) indicating if the planet is habitable\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth is not listed in the dataset, but is assumed to be the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that finds the **shortest path from Earth to a given target planet** using the provided teleportation range constraint.\n",
    "2. The function should:\n",
    "   - Begin from Earth at `(0, 0, 0)`\n",
    "   - Traverse through neighboring planets (within distance constraint)\n",
    "   - Return the sequence of planet names in the teleportation path and the total number of steps and distance\n",
    "3. You are not exepcted to upload any output file to the portal for this task. But ensure you have the path output printed in your final cell of the notebook.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Source planet - Earth - (0,0,0)\n",

    "## What You Can Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)\n",
    "- Data structures like graphs, trees, or priority queues (you may use `networkx` if desired)\n",
    "- `scipy.spatial` or any method to compute 3D Euclidean distances\n",
    "- You are free to write your own logic for graph traversal (recommended!)\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Please do not use libraries like `dijkstra_path` or any shortest path one-liners. The goal is to evaluate your algorithm-building skills.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctness of your shortest path implementation\n",
    "- Ability to dynamically compute neighbors based on 3D distance\n",
    "- Logical structure, code clarity, and modularity\n",
    "- Handling of edge cases (e.g., unreachable planets, cycles)\n",
    "- Efficient use of data structures and distance calculations\n",

    "### Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the **shortest path with constraints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every journey starts from Earth with **100 health points (HP)**\n",
    "- Each visited planet reduces or restores health:\n",

    "  - Air planet: -15HP\n",
    "  - Water planet: -10HP\n",
    "  - Rock planet: -5HP\n",
    "  - Liveable planet: Resets health to 100HP\n",
    "- A planetâ€™s dominant element is the one with the **highest proportion**\n",
    "- If no path can be taken without reaching 0 health, return that the path is **not possible**\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ’¡ Return the full path, total distance, and remaining health (or failure message).\n",

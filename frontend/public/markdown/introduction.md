## Mission Brief

You’ve been recruited by Earth’s premier astrophysics agency to assist in a high-stakes scientific investigation beyond our solar system. Using cutting-edge data from deep space, your mission is to help uncover hidden patterns, predict unknown phenomena, and chart the safest routes across the cosmos.

## What Awaits You

This assessment will test your data science skills across a range of core domains through four themed coding challenges:

- **Simulation & Visualization**
- **Clustering & Pattern Detection**
- **Predictive Modeling**
- **Pathfinding in 3D Space**


## What We’re Looking For

- **Clarity in code**: Well-structured, readable, and efficient.
- **Reasoning**: We value how you approach the problem as much as the final result.
- **Insightful analysis**: Visuals, comments, or concise explanations go a long way.
- **Creativity**: While this isn’t a research exercise, we value thoughtful and well-reasoned solutions. Apply scientific thinking to reach clear, data-driven outcomes.

## Assistant Support

Throughout the assessment, you’ll have access to a built-in **chat assistant** to help guide you. This assistant is here to provide:

- Conceptual clarifications  
- Technical definitions and examples  
- Guidance on approach and methodology  

It is **not** designed to give you direct answers. Instead, it helps us understand your problem-solving process by how you ask questions and apply what you learn.

## Important Guidelines

- **Use the assistant wisely**: We encourage you to use the chat assistant. Your prompts give us insight into your thinking process. However, it won’t give you direct solutions—it’s here to support your understanding and help you stay on track. Also not that the assisstant will not persist your conversations upon logging out or refreshing the scree. So, everytime you relaod/log back in, you will not be able to see your previous interactions. We encourage you to take notes of the interactions if they are important to you.

- **Take your time**: You have **7 days** to complete all coding tasks from when you start the assessment. There’s no need to rush fit the assessment around your schedule. You can log in and resume at any time.

- **Deadline reminder**: While you have 7 days, the **final deadline for submission is May 16th**. Please ensure all tasks are submitted before this date.

- **One-way progression**: Once you submit a task, you **cannot return to it**, and you won’t see the next task until the current one is submitted. Choose your submission time thoughtfully, and manage your time wisely across all tasks.

- **Technical issues**: If you face any problems with the assessment portal, please reach out to the *Vignesh Ravishankar (Vignesh.Ravishankar@rockwellautomation.com)* immediately for assistance.

# ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You have successfully completed the MCQ section of the assessment.

## Next: Coding Section

In the coding section, you will complete a series of programming tasks that will test your ability to solve real-world data science problems. You will:

- **Download and work with Jupyter notebooks** - Each task comes with its own notebook containing instructions and starter code.
- **Analyze datasets and implement algorithms** - You'll analyze provided data and implement solutions to specified problems.
- **Submit your solutions for each task** - Upload both your completed notebook and the output files generated.

## Preparation

Make sure you have:

- A working Python environment with Jupyter installed
- Familiarity with common data science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, etc.)
- A quiet space where you can focus without interruptions

## Time Management

Each task has its own time limit, so manage your time efficiently. Read all instructions carefully before beginning implementation, and focus on completing the core requirements before adding additional optimizations.
